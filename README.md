LANDslide Susceptibility Evaluation

## Brief software decription
LAND-SE (LANDslide Susceptibility Evaluation) is a software developed to prepare landslide susceptibility models and zonation at basin and regional scale, with specific functions focused on results evaluation and uncertainty estimation. The software is implemented in R, a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics (R Core Team, 2015). In the field of landslide susceptibility zonation, LAND-SE is designed to be properly and productively used by experienced geomorphologists. Experienced practitioners are expected to use the code, with the support of experts in the field of environmental planning and management for a correct and reliable interpretation and exploitation of the results.
